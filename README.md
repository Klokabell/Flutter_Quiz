# quiz_app

## Overview 
A basic quiz app initially built as part of a flutter development course created by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller before I made a custom solution to match the final product as an exercise. It was developed using an emulated google pixel 3a and the interface was built with this screen specifications in mind.

## Description
This is a simple 6 question multiple choice quiz app that randomises the answer order each turn and provides the user an overview of their results at the end, highlighting their answer and the correct answer before allowing them to retake the quiz.
